The Void - minimalist command line mind-mapping tool. Designed for light brainstorming, note-taking and thinking.
- To install dependencies, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- To run the void, cd into the_void and type: ```python the_void.py```
- Recommended usage: type small stuff, and press Enter to cycle through things you've typed.
- Graph structure created as you go, which you can view with /g (type ? for commands)
- Save, load, archive and create new sessions with /s, /l, /a
- Features include search navigation, condensing node w/ neighbors, and tournament-style bracket to pick a node (useful for todos!).
